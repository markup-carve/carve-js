/**
 * Serialize a parsed document to the PART 12 exchange shape.
 *
 * The runtime `Document` keeps two pieces of document-level content on the
 * ROOT: `frontmatter`, and `footnoteDefs` keyed by label. PART 12 §7 requires
 * the serialized root to carry exactly `type`, `children` and `srcByteLength`,
 * with both of those as block nodes in the tree, because a root FIELD cannot
 * carry the `pos` §4 requires of every node - and a footnote body or a
 * frontmatter block is source an editor navigates to (carve#411).
 *
 * The runtime shape is deliberately left alone. Renderers, extensions and the
 * profile filter read `footnoteDefs` from the root in some 39 places, and
 * downstream consumers (carve-lsp, pandoc-carve) read it too, so reshaping the
 * in-memory tree would be a breaking change made to serve a wire format.
 * PART 12 §1 anticipates exactly this: an implementation whose internals differ
 * "MAPS on the way out; it does not export its internals".
 *
 * The two wire node types are declared HERE rather than added to `BlockNode`.
 * Widening that union would force every exhaustive switch in every renderer to
 * handle nodes the renderers never see, since neither type exists in a parsed
 * tree - they are produced only by this function.
 *
 * Consumers that need conformant JSON must call this rather than stringifying
 * `parse()` directly.

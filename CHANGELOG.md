# Changelog

All notable changes to carve-js are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The Markdown renderer no longer de-escapes underscores inside verbatim
  content.** The intraword-underscore cleanup matched a literal `\_` anywhere in
  the assembled document, so a backslash the author wrote was rewritten along
  with the escapes the renderer added: `` `a\_b` `` came back as `` `a_b` ``,
  and the same happened in fenced code blocks, link destinations, image sources
  and escaped raw HTML. Each of those dropped a byte the parser had kept - a
  code span does not process escapes, so its value carries the backslash
  literally. The cleanup now decides on a sentinel only the text escaper emits,
  so it sees exactly the escapes the renderer wrote.

- **The canonical writer no longer escapes punctuation that needs no escape**
  (PART 11). `carve fmt` turned ordinary prose into backslash soup - a sentence
  reading `50% faster: yes (ok).` came back as `50\% faster\: yes \(ok\).`,
  where every one of those escapes re-parses to exactly the same document.
  The writer now renders the minimal form, checks it against the conservative
  form, and keeps the escapes only when dropping them would change the parse.

  Three details are worth knowing, because each is forced rather than chosen:

  The check is document-scoped. Verifying a single block would lose the
  document's link and footnote definitions, so a paragraph carrying a reference
  link comes back with an empty href and reports a difference escaping never
  caused.

  It compares the two renders rather than comparing against the source AST. The
  writer does not satisfy `parse(fmt(x)) == parse(x)` for every construct today -
  tables with a colspan, doubled alignment markers, one list-item-attribute shape
  and one line-block shape all re-parse to a different AST while rendering
  identical HTML. Comparing against the original would inherit those defects and
  flip the escaping decision between passes, breaking idempotence for a reason
  unrelated to escaping.

  The caret stays escaped in both modes. Its escape carries information the AST
  records separately - a text node whose leading caret came from an escape is
  flagged, so an image followed by a caret line is not promoted to a figure.
  Comparing that flag would escalate any document whose text begins with a
  caret; ignoring it would silently turn the image case into a figure.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Smart typography is represented as AST nodes instead of character
  substitution** (carve#339). A `smart_punctuation` inline node carries the
  resolved `kind` and the author's source `value`, so `renderCarve` reproduces
  what was written (`...`, `->`, `--`, `"`) instead of normalizing it to the
  glyph. `carveToHtml(fmt(x))` still equals `carveToHtml(x)` and `fmt` stays
  idempotent.

  HTML, Markdown, plain text and ANSI resolve the kind back to the same glyph,
  so their output is unchanged - verified byte-identical against the pinned spec
  corpus and against carve-php across the full transform matrix. Quote glyphs
  are locale-dependent and resolved during parsing, so a quote node also carries
  `glyph`.

  Covers the ellipsis, the eleven operators, the em/en dash ladder and the quote
  directions. A dash run partitions into one node per resolved glyph, each
  carrying the hyphens it came from.

  Consumers that accumulate visible text (`inlineText`, the citation entry
  flattener) contribute the resolved glyph, so heading ids and derived text are
  unchanged. Citation entry attribute blocks (`{author= year=}`) are now matched
  across the leading run of nodes rather than a single text node, since the
  quotes inside them are their own nodes.

  For profiles, `smart_punctuation` folds into the `text` trust class - the
  normative vocabulary is unchanged.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Inline literal** via the `` !`…` `` prefix (#359). A `!` immediately before
  a verbatim backtick span renders its content as escaped prose with no
  `<code>` wrapper, so notation that collides with the bare emphasis
  delimiters - phonemic transcription `/kaet/`, glob patterns, paths - needs no
  per-character escaping. It mirrors the `$`-math prefix: content is captured
  verbatim, HTML-escaped, and emitted by every renderer, and a trailing `{…}`
  is the ordinary inline attribute block. A literal `!` immediately before a
  backtick span is written `\!`.
- **Lint rule for indented fenced-code delimiters** (`fence-delimiter-indentation`)
  (#367).
- **SVG `img` fence** (Tier-3, opt-in via `imgFence()`, off by default) (#366,
  #378). An `` ```img `` block renders a sanitized SVG instead of showing the
  source. Sandbox by default: the sanitized SVG is encoded into a
  `data:image/svg+xml` `<img>` the browser isolates (no script, no fetch, no DOM
  access); a host may opt into a live inline `<svg>` (`imgFence({ allowInline:
  true })`) for `currentColor` / CSS theming. When no `{alt=…}` is given, the
  alt text falls back to the SVG's `<title>`.
- **PlantUML preset and an open static-renderers map** (#360, #363). A
  build-time diagram renderer can be plugged in via the css-class-keyed
  renderers map, and static diagram output is wrapped in a uniform `<div>`.
- **Source-line tracking** for editor scroll-sync (#349, #339):
  `data-source-line` is stamped on nested blocks and list items, emitted after
  author attributes for cross-implementation parity.
- The ordered-list delimiter is now recorded in the AST (#342).

### Changed

- **BREAKING: AST node type discriminants now follow the spec node-type
  vocabulary** (#369). The AST is public API (`export * from './ast.js'`), so
  any code that matches on `node.type` must be migrated. Twenty discriminants
  were renamed:

  ```text
  abbreviation-def    -> abbreviation_def
  blockquote          -> block_quote
  caption-number      -> caption_number
  citation-group      -> citation_group
  code-block          -> code_block
  critic-delete       -> delete
  critic-insert       -> insert
  critic-substitute   -> substitution
  crossref            -> heading_ref
  definition-list     -> definition_list
  extension           -> inline_extension
  hard-break          -> hard_break
  list-item           -> list_item
  literal-inline      -> literal_inline
  raw-block           -> raw_block
  raw-inline          -> raw_inline
  soft-break          -> soft_break
  table-cell          -> table_cell
  table-row           -> table_row
  thematic-break      -> thematic_break
  ```

  A mechanical hyphen-to-underscore replacement is **not** sufficient. Five
  nodes were given genuinely new names (`crossref`, `extension`, and the three
  `critic-*` nodes), and `blockquote` contains no hyphen at all, so a naive
  replacement leaves it untouched and silently broken.

  **This fails at runtime, not at compile time.** Consumers that type the
  discriminant as a plain `string` rather than a union get no compiler error
  from a stale name - the branch simply never matches, and the node is silently
  dropped. Two downstream repositories were already broken this way: both
  carve-lsp and pandoc-carve had migrated to the new vocabulary while still
  resolving the published carve-js 0.1.1 (which ships the old names), leaving
  their default branches red. When upgrading, migrate the names and the
  dependency together.

  Known inconsistency: `critic-comment` was left unchanged and is now the only
  discriminant still using kebab-case, even though the three sibling
  `critic-*` nodes were renamed. It is unchanged in this release.

### Fixed

- **Strict column-0 rule for block-attribute lines, image captions, and
  reference/footnote definitions**. A block-level construct opener fires only
  when it begins at its container's content column (column 0 at the top level).
  carve-js previously recognized three such constructs while indented above that
  column, diverging from carve-php (which already implements the rule) and the
  spec oracle: an indented `{…}` block-attribute line attached to the following
  block; an indented image + `^ caption` formed a `<figure>`; and an indented
  reference-link or footnote definition was collected/consumed (resolving a
  reference and rendering nothing) instead of staying literal paragraph text.
  All three now stay literal when indented, while a flush (column-0) attribute
  line, caption, or definition keeps opening exactly as before. carve-js now
  matches carve-php byte-for-byte on these shapes.
- **A below-content-column wrapped definition-list term folds with its leading
  whitespace stripped**. When a `:: term` inside a list item is followed by a
  lazy continuation line that sits below the item content column, that line is a
  lazy continuation and its leading whitespace is now removed before it folds
  into the `<dt>` - matching how a lazy paragraph continuation is stripped, and
  matching carve-php, carve-rs, and the spec oracle. carve-js previously kept
  the stray leading space (`<dt>term\n wrapped</dt>`), producing bytes that
  diverged from the other engines.
- **A sole-image block only absorbs a *glued* trailing attribute block** (carve#295).
  `![a](/u){k=v}` attaches `k="v"` to the bare `<img>`, but `![a](/u) {k=v}` (with a
  space) now keeps the `{k=v}` literal and inlines the image in a paragraph, matching
  the inline glue rule and carve-rs/carve-php; carve-js previously absorbed the
  space-separated block onto the image.
- **A trailing `{…}` after an inert inline node no longer vanishes** (carve#295).
  An attribute block following a mention `@user`, a tag `#tag`, or a soft/hard
  break was attached to that node and then silently dropped at render (those
  renderers emit no attributes). It now stays literal text, matching carve-rs
  and carve-php - mentions and tags are inert stable spans that do not take
  attributes. Legitimate attachment (`` `code`{.c} ``, `[span]{.c}`, `!`x`{.c}`,
  emphasis, symbols, links, images) is unchanged.
- **A definition-list term (`::`) is now a first-class block opener** (carve#295).
  It interrupts an open paragraph or heading like a heading/quote/fence does, so
  `text` / `:: term` opens a definition list and a `:: term` at a list item's
  content column nests a definition list inside the item (previously it folded
  into the item as lazy text). An INDENTED `:: term` below the content column
  still folds, matching heading/quote at the same position. Aligns carve-js with
  carve-rs/carve-php and resolves a cross-engine divergence.
- A post-blank block attached to a nested list item no longer loosens the
  outer item (#322). List looseness is decided per level; a descendant's
  looseness (from a post-blank block or an inner-list blank) no longer
  propagates up to an ancestor item. Matches carve-php and carve-rs.

- **Post-blank list continuation now uses the content-column model** (carve#295).
  A block opener (quote, heading, fence, table, thematic break) or a sublist
  marker must reach the parent item's content column to belong to the item: at
  the content column it nests, below it lazily continues (no blank) or ends the
  item and parses at document level (after a blank), and above it folds in as
  lazy paragraph text. This holds whether or not a blank line precedes the
  child - the blank only decides tight vs loose. It is an intentional divergence
  from djot, which attaches a block opener at any indent past the marker, and
  resolves the B1-B4 divergence classes in carve#295.

- **`carve fmt` no longer corrupts verbatim spans whose content is entirely
  spaces.** The parser's single-space strip now skips all-space content, and
  the serializer pads only where the parser strips. Previously `` `  ` ``
  stripped to an empty verbatim span, which has no representable Carve source
  (a bare `` `` `` reparses as a two-backtick opener), so an all-space inline
  literal degraded across successive `fmt` passes - `` !`  ` `` became
  `` !`` `` and then `` \!`` ``, silently changing the document and breaking
  both the `carveToHtml(fmt(x)) === carveToHtml(x)` invariant and idempotence.
  All-space content is now preserved verbatim: `` `  ` `` renders
  `<code>  </code>` rather than `<code></code>`. The all-space guard matches
  the executable spec's `codeText()` and the CommonMark rule it derives from.
- The definition prepass now tracks list content columns, fixing a
  nested-fence-inside-a-list-item limitation (#364).
- A fenced-code delimiter sits at its container's content column, and a
  list-nested fence keeps its indent through Markdown migration (#361, #362).
- A definition marker requires a literal space after the colon, not a tab
  (#353).
- An ordered list item continues on a 2-space indent after a blank line (#352).
- A trailing backslash at end of input is a hard break; a bare same-level `#`
  continues a heading (#345).
- A thematic break is a contiguous column-zero run only; `markdownToCarve`
  normalizes to `---` (#346).
- Empty and space-initial bold-italic (`/*…*/`) are rejected, matching the spec
  and carve-php (#343).
- A blank line may separate a term from its definition, and a multi-line term
  folds continuation lines like a heading (#335, #336).
- Definition descriptions continue like a list item (loose and `+` forms) and
  support the `:  +` first-block form (#332, #334).
- Definition and footnote bodies continue like list items (#329).
- A profile `maxLength` is enforced before parsing; untrusted presets are
  capped (#331).
- Fixed quadratic parsing of inline tails and block attributes, so pathological
  input parses in near-linear time (#328).
- The formatter preserves the authored list marker (bullet character and
  ordered delimiter) and keeps verbatim content byte-exact through
  normalization (#351, #341).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

- BREAKING: Rename symbol shortcodes from `emoji` to `symbol` in the AST
  (`type: 'emoji'` -> `type: 'symbol'`), HTML renderer option (`emoji` ->
  `symbols`), and profile construct name.
- Add a leading word-boundary guard for symbol shortcodes so text such as
  `a:b:c`, `10:30: x`, and `word:rocket:` stays literal.
- Preserve attributes on HTML-rendered symbol shortcodes by wrapping mapped or
  literal output in a `<span>` when attributes are present.
- Gate the Djot-semantic-shift migration warnings in `carve lint` behind a new
  `--from-djot` flag. By default `carve lint` reports only constructs that
  mis-render in Carve (`**bold**`, `~~strike~~`, `^sup^`, `+` bullets); valid
  Carve that merely differs from Djot (`_x_`, `~x~`, `{=x=}`) surfaces only with
  `--from-djot`. `MigrationWarning` gains a `category` field and
  `MigrationCategory` is exported.

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

Initial release of the **reference TypeScript implementation** of the
[Carve](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve) markup language.
carve-js is the spec oracle: the JS output is the ground truth that all other
implementations are byte-matched against.

### Core parsing and rendering

- Linear-time block and inline parser producing a typed `Document` AST
- Full Tier-1 feature set: headings (H1-H6), paragraphs, emphasis (`/italic/`,
  `*bold*`, `_underline_`, `~strikethrough~`, `^super^`, `,sub,`, `=highlight=`,
  `/*bold-italic*/`), blockquotes with attribution captions, unordered and ordered
  lists, task lists, tables (with colspan/rowspan), inline code and fenced code
  blocks, images (inline and block with captions), horizontal rules, hard breaks,
  YAML frontmatter, admonitions (`::: note`/`tip`/`warning`/`danger`), abbreviations
  (`*[ABBR]:`), mentions (`@user`), hashtags (`#tag`), display and inline math
  (`$$`/`` $` ``), inline extensions (`:type[...]`), attribute blocks (`{#id .class
  key=val}`), raw HTML passthrough (`=html`), comment lines (`%%`), and reference
  links/images
- Inline footnotes (`^[...]`) and block footnote definitions
- Editorial / critic markup (`{+ +}` insert, `{- -}` delete,
  `{~ old~>new ~}` substitute, `{= =}` highlight, `{# #}` comment)
- Smart typography: curly quotes, em/en dashes, ellipsis
- HTML renderer (`renderHtml` / `carveToHtml`) producing canonical output matched
  by all other implementations
- Markdown renderer (`carveToMarkdown`), plain-text renderer (`carveToPlainText`),
  ANSI-colored renderer (`carveToAnsi`)
- Static render mode (`{ mode: 'static' }`) for self-contained HTML without
  client-side scripts; interactive constructs degrade gracefully

### Tier-2 opt-in extensions

- `mathBlock` - fenced ` ```math ` block rendered as `<div class="math display">`
  with author-attribute passthrough (core `$$` display math is always-on Tier-1)
- `citations` - `[@key]` reference citations with typed locators, explicit
  suffixes, and integral/group-level markers (§22)
- `codeCallouts` - annotated callout markers inside fenced code blocks

### Tier-3 opt-in extensions

- citations `bibliography` option - supplying a CSL-JSON pool renders a
  cite-ordered `<ol>` with back-links (a citations capability, not a standalone
  extension)
- `glossary` - `::: glossary` blocks with `:term[word]` inline markers linking to
  `gloss-{slug}` anchors
- `index` - `:index[term]` invisible span markers with a sorted `::: index` block
  collecting back-links
- `headingNumbers` - opt-in section auto-numbering (`1.`, `1.1.`, ...) and
  numbered `</#id>` cross-references via `<span class="section-number">`
- `colorSwatch` - `:color[value]` inline showing a color preview chip; validates
  against the CSS named-color set; configurable position, shape, and tint; auto-
  contrast label variant
- `spoiler` - `:spoiler[text]` inline and `::: spoiler` block (native
  `<details class="spoiler">`)
- `details` - `::: details "Title"` rendered as HTML5 `<details>/<summary>`
- `fencedRender` - generic client-render factory with presets for Mermaid, D2,
  Graphviz, WaveDrom, ABC, Vega-Lite, and Chart.js
- `listTable` - `::: list-table` converts nested lists to `<table>` with full
  block content in cells; supports header-rows/cols and span markers
- `tableOfContents`, `headingPermalinks`, `autolink`, `externalLinks`,
  `wikilinks`, `tabNormalize` - standard document-enhancement extensions

### CLI and tooling

- `carve` binary: `render` (default), `fmt`, `fix`, `lint` subcommands
- `carve fmt` - canonical formatter; semantic-preserving rewrite (trailing
  whitespace, blank-line runs, list markers, fence lengths, attribute spacing);
  `-w` in-place and `--check` CI-gate mode; `carveToCarve(src)` programmatic API
- `carve lint` - validator for broken cross-references, duplicate heading ids,
  unresolved reference links, missing/duplicate footnotes, misplaced attribute
  blocks, and legacy fence syntax; exits non-zero for CI use
- `carve fix` - auto-corrects Djot/Markdown delimiter collisions
- `markdownToCarve` migration helper and `djotToCarve` collision warnings

### Security (always-on, §25-§26)

- URL scheme denylist covering `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, and OS
  protocol-handler schemes
- Dangerous attribute stripping (`on*`, `srcdoc`, `formaction`) on all elements
- CSS `expression()` and `url()` neutralization in style attributes
- Trojan-Source hardening: NFC normalization of heading/footnote ids; bidi and
  zero-width Unicode control characters stripped from text and code content (§26)
- Uniform nesting depth cap of 200

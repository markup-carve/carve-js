### Changed

- **BREAKING: AST node type discriminants now follow the spec node-type
  vocabulary** (#369). The AST is public API (`export * from './ast.js'`), so
  any code that matches on `node.type` must be migrated. Twenty discriminants
  were renamed:

  ```text
  abbreviation-def    -> abbreviation_def
  blockquote          -> block_quote
  caption-number      -> caption_number
  citation-group      -> citation_group
  code-block          -> code_block
  critic-delete       -> delete
  critic-insert       -> insert
  critic-substitute   -> substitution
  crossref            -> heading_ref
  definition-list     -> definition_list
  extension           -> inline_extension
  hard-break          -> hard_break
  list-item           -> list_item
  literal-inline      -> literal_inline
  raw-block           -> raw_block
  raw-inline          -> raw_inline
  soft-break          -> soft_break
  table-cell          -> table_cell
  table-row           -> table_row
  thematic-break      -> thematic_break
  ```

  A mechanical hyphen-to-underscore replacement is **not** sufficient. Five
  nodes were given genuinely new names (`crossref`, `extension`, and the three
  `critic-*` nodes), and `blockquote` contains no hyphen at all, so a naive
  replacement leaves it untouched and silently broken.

  **This fails at runtime, not at compile time.** Consumers that type the
  discriminant as a plain `string` rather than a union get no compiler error
  from a stale name - the branch simply never matches, and the node is silently
  dropped. Two downstream repositories were already broken this way: both
  carve-lsp and pandoc-carve had migrated to the new vocabulary while still
  resolving the published carve-js 0.1.1 (which ships the old names), leaving
  their default branches red. When upgrading, migrate the names and the
  dependency together.

  Known inconsistency: `critic-comment` was left unchanged and is now the only
  discriminant still using kebab-case, even though the three sibling
  `critic-*` nodes were renamed. It is unchanged in this release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

- BREAKING: Rename symbol shortcodes from `emoji` to `symbol` in the AST
  (`type: 'emoji'` -> `type: 'symbol'`), HTML renderer option (`emoji` ->
  `symbols`), and profile construct name.
- Add a leading word-boundary guard for symbol shortcodes so text such as
  `a:b:c`, `10:30: x`, and `word:rocket:` stays literal.
- Preserve attributes on HTML-rendered symbol shortcodes by wrapping mapped or
  literal output in a `<span>` when attributes are present.
- Gate the Djot-semantic-shift migration warnings in `carve lint` behind a new
  `--from-djot` flag. By default `carve lint` reports only constructs that
  mis-render in Carve (`**bold**`, `~~strike~~`, `^sup^`, `+` bullets); valid
  Carve that merely differs from Djot (`_x_`, `~x~`, `{=x=}`) surfaces only with
  `--from-djot`. `MigrationWarning` gains a `category` field and
  `MigrationCategory` is exported.

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

Initial release of the **reference TypeScript implementation** of the
[Carve](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve) markup language.
carve-js is the spec oracle: the JS output is the ground truth that all other
implementations are byte-matched against.

### Core parsing and rendering

- Linear-time block and inline parser producing a typed `Document` AST
- Full Tier-1 feature set: headings (H1-H6), paragraphs, emphasis (`/italic/`,
  `*bold*`, `_underline_`, `~strikethrough~`, `^super^`, `,sub,`, `=highlight=`,
  `/*bold-italic*/`), blockquotes with attribution captions, unordered and ordered
  lists, task lists, tables (with colspan/rowspan), inline code and fenced code
  blocks, images (inline and block with captions), horizontal rules, hard breaks,
  YAML frontmatter, admonitions (`::: note`/`tip`/`warning`/`danger`), abbreviations
  (`*[ABBR]:`), mentions (`@user`), hashtags (`#tag`), display and inline math
  (`$$`/`` $` ``), inline extensions (`:type[...]`), attribute blocks (`{#id .class
  key=val}`), raw HTML passthrough (`=html`), comment lines (`%%`), and reference
  links/images
- Inline footnotes (`^[...]`) and block footnote definitions
- Editorial / critic markup (`{+ +}` insert, `{- -}` delete,
  `{~ old~>new ~}` substitute, `{= =}` highlight, `{# #}` comment)
- Smart typography: curly quotes, em/en dashes, ellipsis
- HTML renderer (`renderHtml` / `carveToHtml`) producing canonical output matched
  by all other implementations
- Markdown renderer (`carveToMarkdown`), plain-text renderer (`carveToPlainText`),
  ANSI-colored renderer (`carveToAnsi`)
- Static render mode (`{ mode: 'static' }`) for self-contained HTML without
  client-side scripts; interactive constructs degrade gracefully

### Tier-2 opt-in extensions

- `mathBlock` - fenced ` ```math ` block rendered as `<div class="math display">`
  with author-attribute passthrough (core `$$` display math is always-on Tier-1)
- `citations` - `[@key]` reference citations with typed locators, explicit
  suffixes, and integral/group-level markers (§22)
- `codeCallouts` - annotated callout markers inside fenced code blocks

### Tier-3 opt-in extensions

- citations `bibliography` option - supplying a CSL-JSON pool renders a
  cite-ordered `<ol>` with back-links (a citations capability, not a standalone
  extension)
- `glossary` - `::: glossary` blocks with `:term[word]` inline markers linking to
  `gloss-{slug}` anchors
- `index` - `:index[term]` invisible span markers with a sorted `::: index` block
  collecting back-links
- `headingNumbers` - opt-in section auto-numbering (`1.`, `1.1.`, ...) and
  numbered `</#id>` cross-references via `<span class="section-number">`
- `colorSwatch` - `:color[value]` inline showing a color preview chip; validates
  against the CSS named-color set; configurable position, shape, and tint; auto-
  contrast label variant
- `spoiler` - `:spoiler[text]` inline and `::: spoiler` block (native
  `<details class="spoiler">`)
- `details` - `::: details "Title"` rendered as HTML5 `<details>/<summary>`
- `fencedRender` - generic client-render factory with presets for Mermaid, D2,
  Graphviz, WaveDrom, ABC, Vega-Lite, and Chart.js
- `listTable` - `::: list-table` converts nested lists to `<table>` with full
  block content in cells; supports header-rows/cols and span markers
- `tableOfContents`, `headingPermalinks`, `autolink`, `externalLinks`,
  `wikilinks`, `tabNormalize` - standard document-enhancement extensions

### CLI and tooling

- `carve` binary: `render` (default), `fmt`, `fix`, `lint` subcommands
- `carve fmt` - canonical formatter; semantic-preserving rewrite (trailing
  whitespace, blank-line runs, list markers, fence lengths, attribute spacing);
  `-w` in-place and `--check` CI-gate mode; `carveToCarve(src)` programmatic API
- `carve lint` - validator for broken cross-references, duplicate heading ids,
  unresolved reference links, missing/duplicate footnotes, misplaced attribute
  blocks, and legacy fence syntax; exits non-zero for CI use
- `carve fix` - auto-corrects Djot/Markdown delimiter collisions
- `markdownToCarve` migration helper and `djotToCarve` collision warnings

### Security (always-on, §25-§26)

- URL scheme denylist covering `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, and OS
  protocol-handler schemes
- Dangerous attribute stripping (`on*`, `srcdoc`, `formaction`) on all elements
- CSS `expression()` and `url()` neutralization in style attributes
- Trojan-Source hardening: NFC normalization of heading/footnote ids; bidi and
  zero-width Unicode control characters stripped from text and code content (§26)
- Uniform nesting depth cap of 200
